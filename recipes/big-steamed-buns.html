		Spirited Away was a movie out of this world. From the scenery, to the characters, to the plot, the whole<br>
		picture was a truly incredible experience. The big steamed buns that Chihiro eats with one of her mentors<br>
		can be lived through this recipe, courtesy of Feast of Fiction.<br><br>
		Their original recipe can be found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdEFkjbG90g">here</a>.
